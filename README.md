## Adding images to a wiki page

You can simply drag and drop images into the page editor, or even paste images from your clipboard. Github will automatically upload the image and place it in an approprimate image tag.

You can also specify the width of the tag. 640 is recommended for large, important images, and 480 and 360 for less important detail/explanatory images.

## Uploading a file & adding it to a page

1. On the main repo page (what you're probably looking at right now) on Github, navigate to the **Files** folder.
2. At the top-right, click **Add file**, then **Upload file**.
3. Enter a description, then click **Commit changes**.
4. On your page, create a link to your newly-uploaded file. You can use the markdown template below:

`**Download**: [ðŸ“„your_file_name.ext](../blob/main/Files/your_file_name.ext)`

Please note spaces are not allowed in links and must be replaced with `%20`; for example: `file%20name%20with%spaces.ext`
